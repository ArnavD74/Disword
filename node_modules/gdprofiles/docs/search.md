### search
----------

Hi! It seems like you're going to know *all mechanics* of search user's function. There it is!

#### Examples
-------------

```js
let { search } = require('gdprofiles');

// We're finding user 'Michigun'!

let michigun = await search('michigun'); // => Object

// Also, if we'll try to find user
// by typing his nickname with incorrect
// letter's case...
let gdprofilesModuleCreator = await search('NItroJs'); // => Object
// gdprofiles module will find me!

// Also, if you will type nickname
// with spaces in it
// gdprofiles module will
// automatically replace spaces
// to minuses because gdprofiles.com
// is accepting nicks with minuses
// in it instead of spaces
let myFriend = await search('fakeman cat'); // => Object
```

Not created user:

```js
// Let me try to find user
// who didn't create an account!

let misha = await search('mishaKovalenko17295'); // null
// gdprofiles module returns null
// when account is not found!
```
